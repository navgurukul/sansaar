	"WhatIsProgramming_key1": "What is Programming?",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key2": "By giving <b>instructions</b> to the computer,we can make the computers solve complex problems.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key3": "A set of <b>instructions</b> given to the computer is called a <b>program</b>.<br>The Process of giving instructions to the computer is called <b>programming</b>.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key4": "Doesn't it sound simple that we give instructions(program) to the computer and the computer follows these instructions to solve a complex problem? Giving instructions to the computer is called programming. :)",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key5": "But there is a small problem.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key6": "Computers cannot understand our language like (Hindi, Tamil,  Kannada). Computers can only understand the machine language which is made of 0 and 1. So, it becomes difficult for us to communicate with the computer in machine language.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key7": "Then how can we give instructions to the computer?",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key8": "Therefore, to solve this problem we made some languages like(Java, <span style=\"\">Python</span>, JavaScript) so that we can easily give instructions to the computer. Computers can easily convert these languages into machine language with the help of “another program called a <span style=\"\">compiler</span>.”",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key9": "To give instructions to the computer we need to learn any of these given languages. In this course, we are going to learn the <span style=\"\">python</span> language.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key10": "We will use <span style=\"\">python</span> language to give instructions to the computer.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key11": "In the following video Erica(Engineering Manager at Amazon) and Jerome(Program Manager at Xbox) explains how computer hardware like circuits, CPU, etc are controlled by <span style=\"\">codes</span> that we write. Basically how harware and software works together to <span style=\"\">execute</span> a task. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and creator of Windows OS, explains how OS works. Hope you'd enjoy it.",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key12": "<b>Assignment</b>",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key13": "Have you ever given instructions to anybody or taken instructions from anybody. Can we call that a <b>program</b>?",
	"WhatIsProgramming_key14": "Search for Python language and its applications? How many people in the world use Java?"

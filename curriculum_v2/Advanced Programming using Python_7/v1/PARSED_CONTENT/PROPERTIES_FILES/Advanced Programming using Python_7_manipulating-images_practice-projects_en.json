For example, it will process zophie.png but not zophie.PNG. Change the <span style=\"\">code</span> so that the <span style=\"\">file</span> extension check is case insensitive.",

Modify resizeAndAddLogo.py so that the image must be at least twice the width and height of the logo image before the logo is pasted. Other wise, it should skip adding the logo."
